# Paginated Api and Pagination Table

This project involves building a paginated API using Node.js that returns data in smaller, manageable chunks or pages to enhance performance and user experience. The API can be used to fetch small to large sets of data from a database.

The paginated API uses query parameters such as page size and page number to limit the amount of data returned and determine which portion of data to retrieve. The API endpoint returns the specified page of data along with metadata such as total count and the number of pages available.

The API can be accessed using HTTP requests, and it returns data in a JSON format. The project also involves building a pagination table that allows users to navigate through the data easily
